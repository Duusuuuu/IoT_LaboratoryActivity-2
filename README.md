Laboratory Activity #2: Working with Analog Signal

Objectives:

- Discuss analog signals and its implementation in a Arduino circuit.
- Understand analog to digital signal conversion using the map() function.

Instructions:

- We are instructed to build on the 1st activity. We created the same logic, but applied the following conditions:
- We used pins 8 to 12 for the LEDs
- We made it light up from 12 to 8 with a delay of 1 second (turn all LED on one by one, then turn all LED off one by one)
- We used analogWrite() to control the brightness of LEDs
- We implemented the while() loop function and an array to set the pin modes
